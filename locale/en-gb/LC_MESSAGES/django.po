"\n"
"        <p>PBL Exchange is a forum for the teaching staff at Aalborg "
"University. It is intended for asking questions about supervision of student "
"projects at Aalborg University.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>We have divided the topics into several categories. All questions "
"must be marked with a category.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>You can ask questions. To do this, select Ask question from the "
"top menu. You can tag your questions with tags of your own making.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>You can answer questions. To do this, select the question from "
"the list.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>You can write comments to a question or to an answer. To do this, "
"select Comment below the question/answer that you are</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>All users of PBL Exchange can collect points; the more points you "
"get, the more rights you get as a user. Upvotes and downvotes both affect "
"the point total of a users. To award points to other users, you can upvote "
"their questions, answers and comments if you like these. Likewise, you can "
"downvote those questions, answers and comments that you do not like. If "
"someone has provided an answer to one of your questions that you are "
"particulary happy with, you can mark it as the Best Answer.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>If you have a question that is of particular importance to you, "
"you can set a <b>bounty</b> amounting to some number of your points. The "
"user that writes the best answer (selected by you) will then receive the "
"points from you.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>Sometimes the administrators will create a <b>challenge</b> by "
"selecting certain users that will ask question of particular importance. The "
"user that writes best answer to a challenge question will then be awared a "
"number of points.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>Every now and then there are <b>themes</b> within one of the "
"categories; this is done to highlight issues of particular importance. The "
"questions that fall under this category will be highlighted in the sidebar.</"
"p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>You can search the entire site for specific words. To do this, "
"use the search function in the top right-hand corner.</p>\n"
"\n"
"        <p>PBL Exchange is the tangible outcome of a PBL Development Project "
"carried out in 2017-2018 by Dorina Gnaur, Hans Hüttel, and Kurt Nørmark. The "
"implementation was done by Andreas Klostergaard and Gideon Blegmand; the "
"styling of the user interface is due to Ulrik Stoch Jensen. The software is "
"released under the GPL 3.0 license.</p>\n"
